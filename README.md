# QuantCDN Drupal module

This module acts as a static site generator for Drupal and integrates with the [QuantCDN static edge](https://www.quantcdn.io), and is compatible with Drupal 9.x and 10.x.

QuantCDN is a global CDN engineered specifically for the static web and Jamstack.

It allows one-time compilation and push of an entire Drupal site, as well as tracking and pushes of ongoing content change; the simplest way to export and maintain a static export of your Drupal site.

Development, issues and feature roadmap occurs in the [Github repository](https://github.com/quantcdn/drupal).

## Installation and usage

Latest Drupal documentation is maintained on the [Quant Docs](https://docs.quantcdn.io/docs/integrations/drupal) site.
